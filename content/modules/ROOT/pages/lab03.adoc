= Setup the High Side

This lab will help you setup the [.highside]#highside# system while the `oc-mirror` download is working.

Recall from the architecture diagram (below) that the [.highside]#highside# system needs to be setup to run an _image registry_ inside the disconnected network.
OpenShift provides a `mirror-registry` that is purpose-built for this task.
The `mirror-registry` is a simplified, and portable, version of Red Hat's Quay Image Registry.

You can use any _image registry_ you like, as long as it supports the Docker v2 API, [.underline]#uses TLS encryption#, and [.underline]#requires authenticated image pulls#.
Examples of alternative _image registries_ include.

* Harbor
* JFrog Artifactory
* Sonatype Nexus Repository
* Red Hat Quay Registry (enterprise)

== Lab Overview

The tasks in this lab include:

{counter:overview}. Transfering the installation content to the [.highside]#highside# system using `rsync`

{counter:overview}. Connecting to the [.highside]#highside# system and proving that it's disconnected

{counter:overview}. Installing the `mirror-registry`

* Trusting the generated TLS certificate
* Logging in and creating a new __pull secret__

{counter:overview}. Uploading OpenShift's installation images into your `mirror-registry`

== Out-of-Order operations

In order to make good use of our time together, we will perform the tasks described above out-of-order.

We will start by copying the `mirror-registry` file from the [.lowside]#jump# system to the [.highside]#highside# system, and installing it.
Installing the `mirror-registry` takes ~8 minutes.

We will demonstrate that the [.highside]#highside# system is disconnected while we wait for the download to complete.
Then we will end this section by transferring the ~25GB of OpenShift installation images across the __air gap__ and in to the disconnected `mirror-registry`.

== Creating a Mirror Registry

Begin by using `rsync` to copy the `mirror-registry` file from the [.lowside]#lowside# system to the [.highside]#highside# system.
We will run another `rsync` command a bit later to copy the installation images that `oc-mirror` is still downloading.

Please run the following commands in the other `tmux` pane that is logged in to the [.lowside]#jump# system.

[.lowside,source,bash,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
rsync -avP /mnt/low-side-data/mirror-registry.tar.gz highside:/mnt/high-side-data/

=== Logging in to the highside system

In the real world, customers often access their disconnected systems using a VPN, a jump server, or with dedicated workstations.
In your workshop environment, an exception was created in the firewall that allows the [.lowside]#jump# system to SSH to the [.highside]#highside# system.
Password-less SSH has been enabled for your convenience.

Please log in to the [.highside]#highside# system using `ssh` from the [.lowside]#jump# system.

[.lowside,source,bash,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
ssh highside
----
[.output]
----
[lab-user@jump ~]$ ssh highside
Warning: Permanently added 'highside' (ED25519) to the list of known hosts.
Last login: Wed May  1 07:56:13 2024 from 10.0.6.23
[lab-user@highside ~]$
----

=== Installing the `mirror-registry`

Now that you are logged into the [.highside]#highside# system, change to the __high side transfer directory__ (`/mnt/high-side-data`) and extract the `mirror-registry` files.

[.highside,source,bash,role=execute]
----
cd /mnt/high-side-data
tar -xzvf mirror-registry.tar.gz
----
[.output]
----
image-archive.tar
execution-environment.tar
mirror-registry
----

The automation that installs and configures the `mirror-registry` takes ~5 minutes to complete.
The only option that we will provide is one to set the password for the `init` user to `discopass`.

[.highside,source,bash,role=execute]
----
./mirror-registry install --initPassword discopass
----
[.output]
----
...
INFO[2024-05-04 15:43:41] Quay installed successfully, config data is stored in /home/lab-user/quay-install
INFO[2024-05-04 15:43:41] Quay is available at https://ip-10-0-51-47.ec2.internal:8443 with credentials (init, discopass)
----

[NOTE]
--
We can't move on to the next step of trusting the TLS certificate until the `mirror-registry` has finished installing.
--

=== Trusting the `mirror-registry's` TLS certificate

The `mirror-registry` installer creates its own __self-signed__ TLS certificate that is not trusted by anything, not even the [.highside]#highside# system where it was installed.
The procedure to trust the `mirror-registry's` self-signed TLS certificate is simple.

[TIP]
The `mirror-registry install` options allow users to provide their own certificate, if they were issued one, using the `--sslCert` option.

[%hardbreaks]
Copy the Root Certificate Authority file (`rootCA.pem`) that the `mirror-registry` created in to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CA trust directory.
Then run the `update-ca-trust` command.

[.highside,source,bash,role=execute]
----
sudo cp -v $HOME/quay-install/quay-rootCA/rootCA.pem /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/
sudo update-ca-trust
----
[.output]
----
'/home/lab-user/quay-install/quay-rootCA/rootCA.pem' -> '/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/rootCA.pem'
----

=== Log in to the `mirror-registry`

After the `mirror-registry` TLS certificate has been trusted, log in with `podman`.

The username is `init` and the password `discopass`.

[.highside,source,bash,role=execute]
----
podman login -u init -p discopass $(hostname):8443
----
[.output]
----
Login Succeeded!
----

The `podman login` command creates an authentication file / __pull secret__ at `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/containers/auth.json`, for example: `/run/user/1001/containers/auth.json`.

[NOTE]
--
The `oc-mirror` command looks for _pull secrets_ in multiple locations:

* `$HOME/.docker/config.json` (created on the [.lowside]#lowside jump# system)
* `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/containers/auth.json` (created on the [.highside]#highside# system)
--

== Transfer the installation content [[rsync-content]]

**Make sure the `oc-mirror` download completed successfully before proceeding!**

If `oc-mirror` is still downloading the OpenShift installation images, please jump forward to <<prove-disconnected>>.
But don't forget to come back!

You can confirm the download finished by looking in your `tmux` pane to see if your [.underline]#prompt has returned#, and that the `.tar` archive file was created.

----

After the `oc-mirror` command has completed, use `rsync` on the [.lowside]#jump# system to copy the installation content into `/mnt/high-side-data` on the [.highside]#highside# system.

[TIP]
--
Please run the `rsync` command in your `tmux` session.
This will allow you to keep working on the next section while `rsync` moves ~25 GB of data.
The `rsync` tasks should complete in about 5 minutes.

== Prove that highside is disconnected [[prove-disconnected]]

Looking at the workshop environment diagram, you can see how the [.highside]#highside# system is disconnected.
The [.highside]#highside network# doesn't provide any direct route to the internet.

[NOTE]
--
The [.highside]#highside systems# are configured to use a `nat / squid proxy` server to access a few [.underline]#__**internal**__# resources.

{counter:exceptions}. The [.highside]#highside# system allows inbound SSH & HTTP connections from the [.lowside]#jump# system

{counter:exceptions}. The [.highside]#highside# system is allowed to install RHEL RPMs from the repos inside the Amazon AWS Cloud (not from the public repos at https://cdn.redhat.com)

{counter:exceptions}. Your [.highside]#disco.lab# cluster will be allowed to talk to the Amazon AWS Cloud APIs. More details about this permission will be provided in the next lab

{counter:exceptions}. ðŸ›‘ **Nothing else** is allowed into or out of the [.highside]#highside network#

The xref:appendix01.adoc#proxy[Appendix] has more information about the `nat / squid` proxy configuration.
--

Please use the following commands to prove that the [.highside]#highside# system is unable to connect to [.underline]#openshift.com# and [.underline]#quay.io#.

Recall that:

* The `oc` and `openshift-install` tools were downloaded from [.underline]#openshift.com#
* The OpenShift installation images were downloaded from [.underline]#quay.io#

If you try to access a **blocked website**, like [.underline]#quay.io#, you will see an **Access Denied** message like this.

[.highside,source,bash,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
curl -I quay.io
----
[.output]
----
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
Server: squid/5.5

If you try to access an **allowed website**, like the Red Hat Update Infrastructure (RHUI) repos inside the Amazon AWS Cloud, you will see a message like this.

[.highside,source,bash,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----

If you skipped ahead to prove that the [.highside]#highside systems# are really disconnected while the `oc-mirror` download was still working, it's time to go back to <<rsync-content>>.

== Upload OpenShift's installation images into the mirror-registry

Now that the [.highside]#highside# system has: **a**) received the installation images, **b**) trusts the `mirror-registry's` TLS certificate, and **c**) `podman` has logged in and created a new _pull secret_, you are ready to upload the installation images.

Please begin by adding the `oc`, `oc-mirror` and `openshift-install` commands to the PATH.

[TIP]
Make sure you are using the `tmux` pane that is logged in to the [.highside]#highside# system.

[.highside,source,bash,role=execute]
----
sudo mv -v /mnt/high-side-data/oc /bin/
sudo mv -v /mnt/high-side-data/oc-mirror /bin/
sudo mv -v /mnt/high-side-data/openshift-install /bin/
----
[.output]
----

renamed '/mnt/high-side-data/oc-mirror' -> '/bin/oc-mirror'
renamed '/mnt/high-side-data/openshift-install' -> '/bin/openshift-install'
[lab-user@highside ~]$ 
----

With the mirroring tools installed and configured, it is now time to run `oc-mirror` again, this time on the [.highside]#highside# system, to __upload__ the installation images in to the `mirror-registry`.
The __upload__ process takes ~15 minutes in this workshop environment.

[NOTE]
`oc-mirror` will create several __results files__ in the directory where it was ran.

Please change directories to `/mnt/high-side-data`, and use the `tmux` pane that is logged in to the [.highside]#highside# system to run the next command.

[.highside,source,bash,role=execute]
----

You can click the *Desktop* button and use Firefox to login to your new `mirror-registry`.
You can even see the OpenShift installation images begin to appear.
Don't spend too much time exploring the `mirror-registry's` web pages.
We need to start the next section, **Installing OpenShift**

[TIP]
--
As a convenience, the [.lowside]#jump# system has been configured to automatically trust the [.highside]#highside mirror-registry's# TLS certificate.

This automation means workshop participants don't have to:

* Download the [.highside]#highside mirror-registry's# Certificate Authority (CA) certificate onto the [.lowside]#jump system#.
* Move the CA certificate in to the `/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors` folder
* Run `update-ca-trust`

You're welcome!
